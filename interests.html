    <h1>My interests</h1>
    <p>I am fascinated with culture and history. I know a lot about the colonisation of the Americas, the dark ages,
    Russian history, the world wars and contemporary history (1945 to present). I am also interested in politics,
    but I only discuss politics with my closest friends and family. I'll refuse to talk with anyone else, no matter how
    trivial the topic might be.</p>
    <p>I always have trouble explaining my passion for culture, I have always been interested in it.
    Especially language, other than my native Dutch I speak English (duh) and I am studying Russian. I can read and write,
    but I am far from fluent. I can listen to a conversation in Russian and usually make out what they are saying but speaking
    is still beyond me. If I become fluent in Russian I would be interested in learning Chinese, it seems like an interesting language
    and the difficulty does not scare me. It actually encourages me, I would feel very proud if I could speak it.
    If I will not learn Chinese, I would probably learn Spanish, Portuguese, Italian or Greek.</p>
    <h1>What do I like to do in my spare time?</h1>
    <p>In my spare time, I like play videogames. My favourite game is Crusader Kings II. You can play as any character
    such as the king of France, the emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire or as a vassal of a ruler. There is no specific goal,
    but if your dynasty goes extinct you will go game-over. The game spans from 769 to 1453. But you can choose when you want to start.
    I also like to read about history and culture, and I am also interested in fitness and I am planning join a gym club.
