    <p id="who">I am Colin de Wit, a 19 year old student from Davinci College. I study application development,
     we have been practicing with a lot of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
     I currently live in Dordrecht but I was born in 29/06/1998 in Rotterdam. My grandparents come from a small island in the Carribean, Aruba.
     It's located right about Venezuela, and it's part of the ABC (Aruba, Bonaire, Cura√ßao) islands.
     To learn more about this beautiful island, you can click the left image. I have no interest living there though,
     I do not speak the language and the island is too small. There's not much to do for me there. </br>
