    <h1>What is HTML and CSS?</h1>
    <p>HTML (<span class="uitleghtml">hyper<span id="t">text</span> <span class="uitleghtml">markup <span class="uitleghtml">language</span></span></span>) and CSS
      (<span class="uitlegcss">cascading <span class="uitlegcss">style <span class="uitlegcss">sheets</span></span></span>) are
      <span id="not">not</span> programming languages. HTML is a markup language and CSS a styling language. So far I have only
      worked a little with Javascript. I found HTML and CSS very difficult at first but now I am much better at using it.
      I am very happy with my choice in education and I do not regret it. I have a lot of fun at school, my classmates and teachers are <span id="amiable">
      amiable.<span>friendly, sociable.</span></span></p>
    <h1>What do I hope to accomplish?</h1>
    <p>Programming is still very new for me, so I have no idea what direction I will take in the future. I feel like a young
     child in a playground, I want to go everywhere simultaneously! For the time being I will simply focus on doing well in school.
     Unrelated to programming, I hope to have a large family oneday.
